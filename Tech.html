      <p>Technology has evolved a lot over the years,</p>
      <p>Can you believe it started with the iPhone 1</p>
      <p>Even though the iPhone 1 is old,</p>
      <p>It still was the first piece and without there would be no other iPhone.</p>
      <p>The technology that we have now is just a better version of older technology</p>
      <p>This means that we can make a iPhone 11 from a iPhone 3</p>
      <p>We just have to change the parts</p>
      <p>It is really simple</p>
